      <dd>The Explore page is the heart of Campus Connect, 
        designed to keep students in the loop with everything 
        happening across campus organizations. Here, users can 
        scroll through a dynamic feed of club updates, upcoming
        events, volunteer opportunities, and student-led initiatives. 
        Each post includes eye-catching visuals, short descriptions, 
        and quick-access buttons to RSVP or learn more. 
        Whether you're looking to discover new orgs, attend a sustainability fair,
        or join a last-minute trivia night, the Explore page makes it easy to find
        what's going on and get involved in real time. It's the perfect spot for
        curious, active students to stay engaged and connected.</dd>
