      <dt>Key Features</dt>
      <dd>The Connect page helps students find organizations 
        that match their interests and values. By entering a 
        few keywords or selecting from categories like culture, 
        academics, service, or recreation, users are instantly 
        matched with clubs and orgs that align with their passions. 
        Each match includes a short club description, meeting info, 
        and options to reach out or join directly. Itâ€™s like a 
        personalized campus networking tool, making it easier than
        ever for students to plug into communities that feel like home. 
        Whether you're a freshman looking to get started or an upperclassman 
        exploring something new, the Connect page makes building meaningful 
        involvement simple and fun.</dd>
